# Requirement

- Python 3.8 - 3.11
- Pip

# Datasets:

- 10 folders represent 10 classes.
- Each folder contains multiple images (png format) of a animal picture


# Set up:

- Run `pip install -r setup.txt` on your shell
- Download [dataset](https://husteduvn-my.sharepoint.com/personal/cuong_hm226018_sis_hust_edu_vn/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fcuong%5Fhm226018%5Fsis%5Fhust%5Fedu%5Fvn%2FDocuments%2FC%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng%2Dsv%2FData1%2Erar&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fcuong%5Fhm226018%5Fsis%5Fhust%5Fedu%5Fvn%2FDocuments%2FC%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng%2Dsv&ga=1) 
- Extract the dataset into `./dataset` 
- Run the notebook

# Demo:

- Run `python cli.py model_path your_image_path` to receive the prediction of our pre-trained model in your terminal.
- Run `python gui.py model_path` to open GUI app.

# Re-train the model:

- Download the dataset
- Take a look at `CNN_transferlearning_27052024.ipynb` and re-run

# Pre-trained model:
- If you do not want to re-train, you can download our [model](https://husteduvn-my.sharepoint.com/personal/cuong_hm226018_sis_hust_edu_vn/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fcuong%5Fhm226018%5Fsis%5Fhust%5Fedu%5Fvn%2FDocuments%2FC%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng%2Dsv%2Funiversity%5FHUST%2FIntro%5FTo%5FAI%2F90percentsmodel%2Ekeras&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fcuong%5Fhm226018%5Fsis%5Fhust%5Fedu%5Fvn%2FDocuments%2FC%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng%2Dsv%2Funiversity%5FHUST%2FIntro%5FTo%5FAI&ga=1)
